# AgEnRes_Horizon
This repository contains the R codes used in AgEnRes Deliverable 2.1 to disaggregate non-renewable energy use (fertilizer, fuels, electricity) across crops in EU farming systems. The code is organized into clear pipelines for data preparation, outlier detection, and econometric estimation, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of results.
